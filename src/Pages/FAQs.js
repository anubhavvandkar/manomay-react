            <h2>Types of hearing Losses</h2>
            <h2>Conductive Hearing Loss</h2>
            <p>Conductive hearing loss occurs when there is a problem in the outer or middle ear, making it difficult for sound to reach the inner ear. This type of hearing loss can be caused by various factors such as blockages in the ear canal, damage to the eardrum, or issues with the middle ear bones. Hearing aids are arguably the best solutions for conductive hearing loss.

            <h2>Sensorineural Hearing Loss</h2>
            <p>Sensorineural hearing loss occurs when there is damage to the inner ear (cochlea) or the nerve pathways responsible for transmitting sound from the ear to the brain. If you suspect you have sensorineural hearing loss, it is important to seek professional medical advice and have your hearing evaluated by an audiologist.

            <h2>Mixed Hearing Loss</h2>
            <p>Mixed hearing loss is a type of hearing impairment that occurs when there is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Conductive hearing loss is caused by problems in the outer or middle ear, while sensorineural hearing loss is caused by damage to the inner ear or the nerve pathways that transmit sound to the brain.

            <h2>Age related hearing Losses</h2>
            <p> Age-related hearing loss (also called presbycusis, pronounced prez-buh-KYOO-sis) is hearing loss that occurs gradually for many of us as we grow older. It is one of the most common conditions affecting adults as we age.
